# Project-Exhibition - Software Approach Enigma Machine

# Introduction-
So in this project basically i have wrote a program to simulate the Enigma machine to decrypt the secret code produced by the Enigma machine.
And also try to write a program to decrypt the secret code(cipher text) to (Plaintext) produced by Enigma machine using Proccessing 4.0 software.

# Step-1
So first open our software.

# Step-2 
Here i have wrote the code in java language for make software Enigma Machine.

# Step-3
After run the program you will see like that user interface if you add these type of pictures in your data you can also change the interface.

As you can see in Above image three number and three columns are there , these are Rotor of the our Machine.
And in below image this is our internal connection or we can say that is the connection between the buttons , simulator , switches , plugs.

# Step-4
So the final step is that you have to just set the above three Rotor Position and note down the numbers of positon in any pages , because it will change simultaneously when you Enter your Plaintext. So keep remember the rotor position numbers then Enter the Plaintext's of each word and write down the  Outcomes word because that will be your Encrypted Text.
After then if you want to know the Actual Plaintext throw the Encrypted text so then firstly determine the previous Rotor Position set previous rotor position number and enter the Encrypted Text then you will got your Decrypted text , which you Entered in the first time .
As you can see in the below image.

# So this is the overall Structure of My Project...
